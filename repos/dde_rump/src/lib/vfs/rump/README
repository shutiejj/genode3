The vfs_rump plugin enables access to block device backed file systems
supported by the rump kernel. A single rump kernel is in use for any
number of <rump> nodes. The configuration node takes two arguments:
'fs' specifies the file system type, and 'writeable' specifies if the
mount is read only or writeable, 'writeable' defaults to true.
