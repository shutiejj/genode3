This directory contains a simple utility to serialize the execution of
multiple components. It is configured with "start" XML nodes much like
_init_ however this component relies on its parent to manage all routing
and resources, with the exception of a "config" ROM. No services are
propagated from children to the parent.

A sample configuration to start a consumer after a producer has exited:

! <start name="sequence" caps="100">
!   <resource name="RAM" quantum="128M"/>
!   <route>
!     <any-service> <parent/> <any-child/> </any-service>
!   </route>
!   <config>
!     <start name="producer">
!       <config>
!         ...
!       </config>
!     </start>
!     <start name="consumer">
!       <config>
!         ...
!       </config>
!     </start>
!   </config>
! </start>
