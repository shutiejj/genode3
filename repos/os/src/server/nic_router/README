                       Component for routing NIC packets
                       =================================


Brief
#####

The 'nic_router' component can be used to individually route IPv4 packets
between multiple NIC sessions. Thereby, it can translate between different
subnets. The component supports IP routing, TCP and UDP routing, the
partitioning of the TCP and UDP port spaces, port forwarding, NAT, and can
also act as DHCP server and as DHCP client.


Basics
######

The 'nic_router' component provides multiple sessions of the 'NIC' service
(downlinks) while requesting one 'NIC' session (the uplink) itself. Through
common Genode session routing, the uplink can be connected to any other NIC
server. Inside the component, uplink and downlinks are treated the same. Its
routing algorithm is ultimately controlled through the configuration. NIC
sessions are assigned to domains. Each domain represents one subnet and a
corresponding routing configuration. Currently, each domain can contain
only one NIC session at a time. The assigment of sessions to domains is
controlled through the the common Genode session-policy tag:

! <policy label_prefix="http_server" domain="http_servers" />
! <policy label_prefix="imap_server" domain="imap_servers" />

The domain name can be freely choosen but must be unique. There is no need
to have a policy for the uplink. It is automatically assigned to the domain
named "uplink". For each domain there must be a domain tag:

! <domain name="uplink"       interface="10.0.2.55/24"    />
! <domain name="http_servers" interface="192.168.1.18/24" />
! <domain name="imap_servers" interface="192.168.2.17/24" />

The 'interface' attribute defines two things at once. First, it tells the
router which subnet can be found behind this domain, and second, which IP
identity the router shall use in case it has to communicate as itself with
the subnet. If the 'interface' attribute is not set in a 'domain' tag, the
router acts as DHCP client (Section [Configuring DHCP client functionality]).

Additionaly, the optional 'gateway' attribute can be set for a domain:

! <domain name="uplink" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1" />

It defines the standard gateway of the subnet behind this domain. If a packet
shall be routed to this domain and its final IP destination does not match
the subnet, its Ethernet destination is set to the MAC address of the gateway.
If a gateway isn't given for a domain, such packets get dropped. If a gateway
is given for a domain without an 'interface' attribute, this gateway
configuration is not getting effective.

For each domain, the routing of packets from this domain can be configured
individually by adding subtags to the corresponding domain tag. There are
multiple types of subtags expressing different types of routing rules. The
following table gives a brief overview over the different subtags and their
meaning:

 Subtag                     | Description
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <tcp-forward port="X" />   | Port forwarding for TCP port X *
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <udp-forward port="X" />   | Port forwarding for UDP port X *
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <tcp dst="X">              | Routing TCP packets that target
    <permit-any />          | IP range X *
 </tcp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <udp dst="X">              | Routing UDP packets that target
    <permit-any />          | IP range X *
 </udp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <tcp dst="X">              | Routing TCP packets that target
    <permit port="Y" />     | IP range X and port Y or Z *
    <permit port="Z" />     |
 </tcp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <udp dst="X">              | Routing UDP packets that target
    <permit port="Y" />     | IP range X and port Y or Z *
    <permit port="Z" />     |
 </udp>                     |
---------------------------------------------------------------
 <ip dst="X" />             | Routing IP packets that target
                            | IP range X

A detailed explanation of the different routing rules is given in the
following sections of this document. For all rules marked with a star, the
router also keeps track of corresponding TCP connections and UDP
pseudo-connections. With these so-called link states, corresponding reply
packets are automatically routed back. The user doesn't have to add an
additional back-routing rule for that.

Now having this variety of ways of routing a packet, it is absolutely legal
that for one packet the domain may contain multiple rules that are applicable.
And additionally, there may even be a link state that fits. The router's
choice, however, is always deterministic. It follows a simple priority scheme:

1) Link states
2) Port forwarding rules
3) Longest prefix match amongst TCP respectively UDP rules
   3.1) Subrule that permits any port
   3.2) Subrules that permit specific ports
4) Longest prefix match amongst IP rules


IP rules
########

These are examples for IP rules:

! <ip dst="10.0.2.0/24"     domain="intranet"  />
! <ip dst="192.168.1.18/32" domain="my_server" />
! <ip dst="0.0.0.0/0"       domain="uplink"    />

IP rules only apply to IPv4 packets from the session of the surrounding
domain. The 'dst' attribute is compared with the IP destination of the packet.
The rule with the longest prefix match is taken. The packet is then routed to
the domain given in the rule.

IP rules work pretty simple. They merely affect the Ethernet header of a
packet and they don't imply link-state tracking. This has consequences. First,
IP rules do not automatically route back reply packets from the remote side.
If you like to enable bidirectional communication via IP rules, both domains
must have an appropriate rule in their domain tag. And second, IP rules do not
consider a NAT configuration (Section [Configuring NAT]). As this could lead
to unexpected leakage of local IP addresses and ports, you should use the
combination of IP rules and NAT only with great care.


TCP and UDP rules
#################

TCP and UDP rules must always be accompanied by one or more port permission
rules to get effective:

! <tcp dst="192.168.1.18/32">
!    <permit port="70" domain="gopher_servers" />
!    <permit port="80" domain="http_servers" />
! </tcp>
! <udp dst="10.0.2.0/24">
!    <permit-any domain="uplink" />
! </udp>

TCP rules only apply to TCP packets and UDP rules only to UDP packets from the
session of the surrounding domain. The 'dst' attribute is compared with the IP
destination of the packet. The rule with the longest prefix match is taken.
If the rule contains a 'permit-any' subrule or a 'permit' subrule whose 'port'
attribute matches the destination port of the packet, the packet is routed to
the domain given in the subrule.

For bidirectional traffic, you'll need only one TCP or UDP rule describing the
client-to-server direction. The server-sided domain doesn't need a rule as the
router correlates replies to the client-sided rule (and only those) via a link
state (Section [Link states]) that was created at the clients initial request.

TCP and UDP rules consider whether the router shall apply NAT
(Section [Configuring NAT]) for the client side. If this is the case, source
IP and port are replaced by the router's IP identity and a free port at the
server-sided domain. Also the corresponding link state takes this in account
to change back the destination of the replies.


Port-forwarding rules
#####################

These are examples for port-forwarding rules:

! <tcp-forward port="80" domain="http_servers" to="192.168.1.18" />
! <udp-forward port="69" domain="tftp_servers" to="192.168.2.23" />

Port-forwarding rules only apply to packets that come from the session of the
surrounding domain and are addressed to the router's IP identity at this
domain (Section [Basics]). Amongst those, 'tcp-forward' rules only apply to
the TCP packets and 'udp-forward' rules only to the UDP packets. The 'port'
attribute is compared with the packet's destination port. If a matching rule
is found, the IP destination of the packet is changed to the value of the 'to'
attribute. Then, the packet is routed to the domain given in the rule. Note
that the router accepts only system and registered ports (0 to 49151) for port
forwarding.

For bidirectional traffic, you'll need only one port-forwarding rule
describing the client-to-server direction. The server-sided domain doesn't
need a rule as the router correlates replies to the client-sided rule (and
only those) via a link state (Section [Link states]) that was created at the
clients initial request.

It's in the nature of port forwarding that it comes along with NAT for the
server side. However, the router only translates the server IP. The port
remains unchanged. For the client side, port-forwarding rules apply NAT only
when configured (Section [Configuring NAT]). If this is the case, client IP
and port are translated.


Link states
###########

Each time a packet gets routed by using a TCP, UDP, or port-forwarding rule,
the router creates a link state. From then on, all packets that belong
to the exchange this first packet initiated and come from one of the two
involved domains are routed by the link state and not by a rule. The costs
for the link state are paid by the session that sent the first packet.

If a link state exists for a packet, it is unambiguously correlated through
the source IP and port as well as the destination IP and port. This is also
the case if the transfer includes NAT no matter of what kind or for which
side.

It is desirable to discard a link state as soon as it is not needed anymore.
The more precise the algorithm for that, the more efficient can NIC sessions
use their resources (ports, RAM), and the less is the risk for DoS attacks.
In order to meet this requirement, the router needs to know the round-trip
time of the exchange behind a link state. This value is given through the
attribute 'rtt_sec' in the router's configuration:

! <config rtt_sec="3"> ... </config>

This would set the round-trip time to three seconds. The value is used for all
link states so you should choose it with care. If it is too low, replies that
normally need no routing rule may get lost. If it is too high, link states are
held longer than necessary.

In general, each link state is discarded after a duration of the round-trip
time without a matching packet. For UDP link states, this is the only rule and
better known as hole punching. It allows peers to keep alive a UDP
pseudo-connection through the router by frequently sending empty packets.  The
need for such a pseudo-connection arises from the router's demand to support
NAT for UDP transfers and the consequence of keeping the corresponding mapping
information.

The lifetime management of TCP link states, in contrast, is more complex. In
addition to the common timeout, they may be discarded even if they still
receive packets. This is the case when the router observed the four-way
termination handshake of TCP and the round-trip time has passed.


Configuring NAT
###############

In contrast to routing rules that affect packets coming from their domain,
NAT rules affect packets that go to their domain:

! <domain name="uplink" interface="10.0.2.55/24">
!    <nat domain="http_client" tcp-ports="6" />
! </domain>

This would tell the router to apply NAT for the HTTP client when it speaks to
the uplink. This means, it affects all packets from the HTTP client that get
routed to the uplink by using a UDP, TCP, or port-forwarding rule respectively
a corresponding link state. If this is the case, the packet's source IP
address is changed to "10.0.2.55" and the source port is replaced by a free
source port of the router. When saying "free source port" this actually means
a port that the router currently doesn't use at the destination domain. So,
at each domain, the router has two complete port spaces for source NAT
available. One for UDP and one for TCP. Each port space contains the IANA
dynamic port range 49152 to 65535.

As you can see, the NAT rule also has a 'tcp-ports' attribute. It restricts
how many TCP source ports of the uplink the HTTP client may use at a time. The
same goes also for UDP:

! <nat domain="tftp_client" udp-ports="13" />

And even combined:

! <nat domain="intranet" tcp-ports="43" udp-ports="21" />

If one of the two attributes is not set, this means that no port shall be used
for this protocol which effectively disables it. Thus, at least one of the two
attributes must be set for the NAT rule to be sensible. Restricting the port
usage is necessary to avoid that a client can run Denial-of-Service attacks
against the destination domain by occupying all of its ports.


Configuring DHCP server functionality
#####################################

One can configure the NIC router to act as DHCP server at interfaces of a
domain by adding the <dhcp> tag to the configuration of the domain like
this:

<domain name="vbox" interface="10.0.1.1/24">
    <dhcp-server ip_first="10.0.1.80"
                 ip_last="10.0.1.100"
                 ip_lease_time_sec="3600"
                 dns_server="10.0.0.2"/>
    ...
</domain>

The attributes ip_first and ip_last define the available IPv4 address
range while ip_lease_time_sec defines the lifetime of an IPv4 address
assignment in seconds. The IPv4 address range must be in the subnet
defined by the interface attribute of the domain tag and must not cover
the IPv4 address in this attribute. The dns_server attribute gives the
IPv4 address of the DNS server that might also be in another subnet.
The lifetime of an offered assignment is the configured round-trip time of
the router while ip_lease_time_sec is applied only when the offer is
acknowledged by the client in time.


Configuring DHCP client functionality
#####################################

If the attribute 'interface' is not set in a 'domain' tag, the router tries to
dynamically receive and maintain an IP configuration for that domain by using
DHCP in the client role at all interfaces that connect to the domain. In the
DHCP discover phase, the router simply chooses the first DHCP offer that
arrives. So, no comparison of different DHCP offers is done. In the DHCP
request phase, the server is expected to provide an IP address, a gateway, a
subnet mask, and an IP lease time to the router. If anything substantial goes
wrong during a DHCP exchange, the router discards the outcome of the exchange
and goes back to the DHCP discover phase. At any time where there is no valid
IP configuration present at a domain, the domain does only act as DHCP client
and all other router functionality is disabled for the domain. A domain cannot
act as DHCP client and DHCP server at once. So, a 'domain' tag must either
have an 'interface' attribute or must not contain a 'dhcp-server' tag.


Examples
########

This section will list and explain some interesting configuration snippets. A
comprehensive example of how to use the router (except DHCP server
functionality) can be found in the test script 'libports/run/nic_router.run'.
For an example of how to use the DHCP server and the DHCP client functionality
see the 'ports/run/virtualbox_nic_router.run' script.

The environment for the examples shall be as
follows. There are two virtual subnets 192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24 that
connect as Virtnet A and B to the router. The standard gateway of the virtual
networks is the NIC router with IP 192.168.*.1 . The router's uplink leads to
the NIC driver that connects the machine with your home network 10.0.2.0/24.
Your home network is connected to the internet through its standard gateway
10.0.2.1 .


Connecting local networks
=========================

Let's assume we simply want the virtual networks and the home network to be
able to talk to each other. Furthermore, the virtual networks shall be able to
use the internet connection of your home network. The router would have the
following configuration:

! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_a" domain="virtnet_a" />
! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_b" domain="virtnet_b" />
!
! <domain name="uplink" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1/24">
!    <ip dst="192.168.1.0/24" domain="virtnet_a"/>
!    <ip dst="192.168.2.0/24" domain="virtnet_b"/>
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_a" interface="192.168.1.1/24">
!    <ip dst="192.168.2.0/24" domain="virtnet_b"/>
!    <ip dst="0.0.0.0/0"      domain="uplink"/>
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_b" interface="192.168.2.1/24">
!    <ip dst="192.168.1.0/24" domain="virtnet_a"/>
!    <ip dst="0.0.0.0/0"      domain="uplink"/>
! </domain>

IP packets from Virtnet A and uplink that target an IP address 192.168.2.* are
routed to Virtnet B. IP packets from Virtnet B and uplink that target an IP
address 192.168.1.* are routed to Virtnet A. Packets that are addressed to
hosts in the same local network should never reach the router as they can be
transmitted directly. If there's a packet from one of the virtual networks
that doesn't target 192.168.1.* or 192.168.2.*, the IP 0.0.0.0/0 rules route
them to the uplink. If these packets target an IP 10.0.2.*, the router sends
them directly to the host in your home network. Otherwise, the router sends
them to your gateway 10.0.2.1 . Note that none of the packets is modified on
layer 2 or higher, so, no NAT is done by the router to hide the virtual
networks.


Clients in a private network
============================

Now we have some clients in Virtnet A that like to talk to the internet as
well as to the home network. We want them to be hidden via NAT when they do so
and to be limited to HTTP+TLS/SSL and IMAP+TLS/SSL when talking to the
internet. The router would have the following configuration:

! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_a" domain="virtnet_a" />
! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_b" domain="virtnet_b" />
!
! <domain name="uplink" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1/24">
!    <nat domain="virtnet_a" tcp_ports="1000" udp_ports="1000">
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_a" interface="192.168.1.1/24">
!    <tcp dst="10.0.2.0/24"><permit-any domain="uplink" /></tcp>
!    <udp dst="10.0.2.0/24"><permit-any domain="uplink" /></udp>
!    <tcp dst="0.0.0.0/0">
!       <permit port="443" domain="uplink" />
!       <permit port="993" domain="uplink" />
!    </tcp>
! </domain>

From the packets that come from Virtnet A, those that target an IP 10.0.2.*
are routed to the uplink without inspecting the port. At the uplink, the
router notices that it shall apply NAT for Virtnet A. It replaces the source
IP with 10.0.2.55 and allocates one of its uplink source ports for the
exchange. On replies to Virtnet-A packets from the home network, the router
translates IP and port back using the corresponding link state. For packets
from Virtnet A that target other IPs, only the 0.0.0.0/0 rule applies and only
if the packet targets TCP port 443 or 993. Both ports route the packet to the
uplink where, again, NAT is applied and the packets are sent to the gateway
10.0.2.1 .


Servers in a private network
============================

In this example, we assume that there are three servers in Virtnet A. An HTTP
server at port 80 with IP 192.168.1.2, a GOPHER server at port 70 with IP
192.168.1.3, and a TFTP server at port 69 with IP 192.168.1.4 . Now you want
the servers (and only them) to be reachable to the home network via the
router's IP and to the internet via your gateway. The router would have the
following configuration:

! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_a" domain="virtnet_a" />
! <policy label_prefix="virtnet_b" domain="virtnet_b" />
!
! <domain name="uplink" interface="10.0.2.55/24" gateway="10.0.2.1">
!    <tcp-forward port="80" domain="virtnet_a" to="192.168.1.2" />
!    <tcp-forward port="70" domain="virtnet_a" to="192.168.1.3" />
!    <udp-forward port="69" domain="virtnet_a" to="192.168.1.4" />
! </domain>
!
! <domain name="virtnet_a" interface="192.168.1.1/24" />
! <domain name="virtnet_b" interface="192.168.1.1/24" />

Amongst the packets that come from the uplink, only those that are addressed
to 10.0.2.55 and TCP port 80, TCP port 70, or UDP port 69 are forwarded.
All these packets are forwarded to Virtnet A. But beforehand, their IP
destination is adapted. TCP-port-80 packets are redirected to 192.168.1.2,
TCP-port-70 packets to 192.168.1.3, and UDP-port-69 packets to 192.168.1.4.

Amongst the packets that come from Virtnet A, only those that match a link
state at the uplink are forwarded, because the Virtnet-A domain contains no
rules. Thus, Virtnet A can only talk to the uplink in the context of
TCP-connections or UDP pseudo-connections that were opened by clients behind
the uplink. The servers IP addresses never leave Virtnet A.
